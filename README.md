# Machine_Learning_Algorithmic_Trading_Bot

**LAUNCH APP**: https://share.streamlit.io/lariannrupp/machine_learning_algorithmic_trading_bot/main/streamlit.py

---
## User Story: 

A non-technical user can choose which stock sector they want to invest in, be presented with a prepackaged machine learning model, and deploy the trading bot to their Alpaca trading account

---

## Method:

### Part 1 - Create a stable machine-learning framework for the trading bots

1. Create a baseline scikit-learn machine learning algorithm that pulls live pricing data from Alpaca API


2. Duplicate the algorithm with stocks from different market sectors


3. Perform backtesting analysis on the baseline models 



### Part 2 - Produce a set of trading bots that are trained to their market sectors and deploy one to the Alpaca trading environment


4. Optimize each model based on their unique market sector conditions


5. Perform backtesting analysis on the optimized models


6. Deploy a model into the Alpaca environment so it becomes a live trading bot



### Part 3 Visualize the data for a user and give user instruction for deploying a trading bot


7. Create a streamlit app that presents the results of the backtesting analyses


8. Within the streamlit app, provide user instructions for deploying the prepackaged market sector trading bot to the Alpaca environment


9. Within the streamlit app, provide user instructions for how to change the ticker of their prepackaged market sector trading bots

Method Next steps:

A Lex bot that which takes user inputs on what stock market sector they want to invest in and recommends one of the prepackaged machine learning models as well as interpretable backtesting results and instructions on how to deploy the model to the Alpaca environment.
